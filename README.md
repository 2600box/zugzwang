# Description
A tool to exploit all jailbroken devices owned by clueless people
* scans for all devices opened to port 22
* tries to connect into them with default root password "alpine"
* if it does, they're yours

# Usage notes
* this py file simply contains the ssh part of the code
* simply launch and type in your host machine's IP and then scan ranges
* program will automatically check if they are open/vulnerable on port 22

# Also
Remember that this is not an exploit. This program simply combines known vulnerabilities into one.
* intention is to have all people with the default root password change it
